    "`Advantages:`\n",
    "  * The algorithm is user-friendly.\n",
    "  * Simple to use as it requires only 4 inputs from the user. \n",
    "  * More weight is assigned to the price variable - good choice, because customers can be very price sensitive.\n",
    "  * Flexibility of the algorithm allows for modification with more variables and/or classifications.\n",
    "  * Easy to test and debug :)\n",
    "  * Can be scaled with no additional effort.\n",
    "  * No ads! (*Well, at least for now...*)\n",
    "\n",
    "`Disadvantages:`\n",
    "  * The scope of flights is very narrow in this case as it covers only MSK-NY flights.\n",
    "  * The scope of variables is very narrow as well. For instance, algorithm does not consider the time of departure & arrival, and for some people it may be critical to fly in comfortable hours. Likewise, the algorithm does not differentiate between different companies and/or planes.\n",
    "  * This algorithm will not perform any better than a more complex if-else statement script (_like the one I wrote below_).\n",
    "\n",
    "`Justification:`\n",
    " * I personally think that the presented criteria is convincing enough, because people would prioritize listed core attributes of the flight over some minor, 2-nd tier details. However, contemporary analysis surely must include other variables. \n",
    " * I'd also suggest that the matrix with weights of attributes should be organized, taking into consideration customer/country profile."

I'll consider time of departure, time of arrival, airports, company name, plane model, etc. It's easier to incorporate best options as boolean variables.
